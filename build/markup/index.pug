						h3 Historic Hurricane Season
						h4 Personal Project | Winter 2017
						p After moving to the coast of South Carolina, I have paid close attention to the weather during hurricane season. This season had a lot of activity so I researched, wrote and created data visuals to see how the season compared to season's in the past. I used Highcharts JS to create bar graphs and line graphs and Highmaps JS to create an SVG graphic showing rainfall in Texas counties. Additionally, I mapped all of the storm paths for the season using Google Maps API.

This fall, we have rebuilt and launched their new company website and are currently working towards adding translations and e-commerce to the website. I was responsible for the front end development of the category pages and single product pages as well as the CMS integration of the single product pages.

						h4 Personal Project | Spring 2017
						p News about a local shark fisherman tagging great white sharks in South Carolina caught my attention, so I reached out to him about an interview. I created this site for a multimedia storytelling experience that has video, photos, and text. This project was a lot of fun because it allowed me to not only work through some development challenges, but also gave me the opportunity to do some videography and photography as well.

						h4 BFG | Spring 2017
						p For the initial development phase of this new website for Sutter Home, I did the front end development for the "Family of Wines" page and the individual wine landing pages. After it was integrated with WordPress and the final data was imported, I was responsible for a pre-launch quality assurance pass. Since it's launch, I have been involved in multiple maintenance updates to improve functionality after post-launch user testing.

						h4 Personal Project | Spring 2017
						p All of the news about President Donald Trump's executive orders in his first weeks in office caught my attention. Using data from the Federal Register's API (which I accessed via AngularJS), I created this website to view the number of executive orders signed not only by Donald Trump, but 3 of his most recent predecessors to see if his activity in his first 100 days in office is standard or if it deviates from tradition.

						p Photography is one of my favorite hobbies, especially when I have the opportunity to travel. I designed and developed this theme for a travel photography blog as a digital scrapbook that I could share with family and friends. For each location, it displays a map of where the photos were taken. I also added in some customization settings to the theme, like the ability to change out the colors and logos.

						h4 BFG | Winter 2016
						p For this project, I worked closely with the creative team to convert a non-responsive site in Expression Engine to a fully responsive website with Wordpress as the CMS. This required a lot of collaboration, because we did not have a full redesign and the team wanted to maintain as much of the strucure and layout as possible. Our team decided to use a 'headless' Wordpress for this project and access all data via the Rest API. I was responsible for the front end development and CMS integration for this website.

						h4 UNC Chapel Hill | Spring 2015
						p Go Golf was a concept developed as part of a group project as a way for golfers to share information about different courses while traveling. My efforts were focused on setting up the models, creating the views and urls as well as setting the structure for the HTML templates. I also did a majority of the design and CSS. I deployed the site using PythonAnywhere and the files are accessible via my GitHub account.
