					<p>I am currently living in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS707US707&espv=2&q=bluffton+sc&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&biw=1736&bih=1004&dpr=1.1&ion=1&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXwpz3yYbSAhWESSYKHQV3DBAQ_AUIBigB" target="_blank">Bluffton, SC</a> and working as a web developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://bfgcom.com">BFG Communications</a>. In addition to my job, I am currently doing some freelance and pro-bono work as well as a few personal projects to improve skills and explore new things.</p>
					<p>I am a proud graduate of the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Carolina's</a> <a href="http://mj.unc.edu/" target="_blank">School of Media and Journalism</a>. I studied web development in journalism along with a second major in media theory and production from the university's communications department.

					<p>Through my education and experiences, I have developed a passion for storytelling in a variety of ways. I love hearing people talk about personal experiences AND analyzing data to find the story in the numbers. Web development has provided a great way for me to explore different mediums of storytelling by using code to cultivate a unique experience.</p>

						h3 Executive Orders
						h4 Personal Project | Spring 2017
						p All of the news about President Donald Trump's executive orders in his first weeks in office caught my attention. Using data fromt he Federal Register's API (which I accessed via AngularJS), I created this website to veiw the number of executive orders signed not only by Donald Trump, but 3 of his most recent predecessors to see if his activity in his first 100 days in office is standard or if it deviates from tradition.

						h4 UNC Chapel Hill | Spring 2015
						p Go Golf was a concept developed as part of a group project as a way for golfers to share information about different courses while traveling. My efforts were focused on setting up the models, creating the views and urls as well as setting the structure for the HTML templates. I also did a majority of the design and CSS. I deployed the site using PythonAnywhere and the files are accessible via my GitHub account.
